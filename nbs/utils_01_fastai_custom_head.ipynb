    "To be able to successfully convert models trained using `fastai` to `CoreML`, we need to replace one function call to `fastai.layers.Flatten()` with `torch.nn.Flatten()`. This is because `fastai`'s version uses one of CoreML's [restricted operators](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs/blob/master/docs/operators.md), which would cause the conversion to CoreML to fail."
